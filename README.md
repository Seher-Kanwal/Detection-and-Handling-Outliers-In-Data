# Outliers
Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the other data points in a dataset. These data points can be much higher or lower than the average value of the dataset and can sometimes be considered "noise" in the data.

## Impact of Outliers:
Outliers can have several negative impacts on machine learning models, including:

- __Skewed results__
   Outliers can cause statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation to be skewed, resulting in inaccurate or biased results.

- __Increased error__

   Outliers can increase the variance of the data, leading to increased error in machine learning models.

- __Overfitting__
  
  Outliers can also lead to overfitting, where a model is overly complex and fits the noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns.

- __Misleading results__

   Outliers can mislead or obscure the underlying patterns in the data, leading to incorrect conclusions or predictions.

- __Reduced generalization__
   
   Outliers can also reduce the generalization of a model, making it less applicable to new data.

It is therefore important to detect and handle outliers appropriately in order to ensure the accuracy and validity of machine learning models.

## Method of Visiualizing the Outliers:
There are several types of plots that can be used to detect outliers in a dataset, including:
- Box plots
- Scatter plots
- Histograms
- QQ plots
- Violin plots
